## Biology of the brain and behavior
#### *seminar*
* 12 hours in class 
* 9 hours worth of e-learning (including student project)

The emphasis of this course is on *PRACTICAL* introduction to neuroscience. 
Students will learn the most important concepts and practices needed to understand and critically review 
neuroscientific findings - in popular press and to some extent in science publications. The goal is to 
provide students with knowledge and skills that are critical in understanding neuroscience information
encountered either self-studying or attending further classes.

### **E-learning**
* the course feaures elements of inverted-classroom - 
  sometimes students watch educational materials at home 
  and classroom time is used for more interactive actvities:
  discussion, practical aspects of learning etc.

### **STUDENT PROJECT**
projects will be completed in groups of 2-4 students and presented in written form
* find something neuroscientific that interests you: maybe function(s) of a given brain region (or a network o regions), or mechanisms of some psychological funcion (other topics are also possible for example: how brain connectivity influences psychological phenomena; what are the neural mechanisms of a specific disorder)
* look for materials about this topic (google scholar, pubmed, science blogs, scholarpedia, book chapters)
* read through these sources, especially abstracts of scientific publications, sum up initial findings
* choose a few papers, look through figures, conclusions (maybe introduction too). describe what you understood, consult what you do not with the teacher
* your final selection should consist of at least one experimental paper that you will discuss in a written form, consider looking for a review paper or some other source of general background information

### IN-CLASS MEETINGS:
#### INTRODUCTION TO NEUROSCIENCE and its METHODS
* very basic introduction to neuroscience and overview of its branches and topics
* short overview of brain anatomy and function
* how do scientists get to know this? overview of neuroscientific methods
  structural and functional methods
  lesion studies, MRI, DTI, marking and tracing methods, (short mention of brainbow - nice pictures)
  fMRI, electode recordings, EEG, TMS, TDCS/TACS
* overview of resources helpful in learning about the brain (brain form top to bottom, scholarpedia ...)
* using Google Scholar and pubmed to find relevant information
* navigating structure of a neuroscientific paper
* understanding (neuro)scientific figures and results

#### NEURONS and NEUROANATOMY
* how do neurons communicate
* mechanisms of action potential generation and synaptic transmission
* neurons are social creatures: from neurons to networks - short discussion / group exercise
* understanding brain anatomy - overview of brain structures 
* presentation of a chosen interactive brain atlas


#### FROM STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION part I -  *motor and sensory systems*
* relationship between brain structure and function
* architecture of the visual system - how the visual information is processed
* how attention influences information processing (in neural terms)
* motor system - how movements are planned and executed

#### FROM STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION part II - *architecture of emotion and cognition*
* brain regions responsible for control of attention
* memory (short and long term)
* fear and happieness
* motivation, reward system
* decision making


#### NEURAL OSCILLATIONS and BRAIN NETWORKS
* networks of communicating brain cells/regions - the real building block of cognition
* structural and functional networks
* how networks are studied
* the role of brain oscillations in network formation and information flow

#### NEUROSCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY - *brain mechanisms of consciousness and free will (volition)*
* consciousness - global neuronal workspace, integrated information, higher order theories of consciousnes, radical plasticity thesis
* volition - Liebet and Soon experiments (unconscious precursors of conscious choices), mechanisms of agency and ownership (the feeling that we are in control of the actions) 

### **OPTIONAL**
This plan does not cover some (arguably important) topics but I can optionally push them somewhere:
- memory systems, neuroplasticity
- neurotransmitters and how they regulate brain function (above what is being covered in synaptic transmission)
- how to build a cognitive system: evolutionary history of human brain
