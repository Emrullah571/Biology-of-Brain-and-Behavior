## Biology of the brain and behavior
#### *seminar*
* 12 hours in class 
* 9 hours worth of e-learning (including student project)

The emphasis of this course is on *PRACTICAL* introduction to neuroscience. 
Students will learn the most important concepts and practices needed to understand and critically review 
neuroscientific findings - in popular press and to some extent in science publications. The goal is to 
provide students with knowledge and skills that are critical in understanding neuroscience information
encountered either self-studying or attending further classes.

### **E-learning**
* the course feaures elements of inverted-classroom - 
  sometimes students watch educational materials at home 
  and classroom time is used for more interactive actvities:
  discussion, practical aspects of learning etc.

### **course materials**
All relevant materials will be posted on https://github.com/mmagnuski/Biology-of-Brain-and-Behavior ahead of time. The course function is supportive to the module lectures (*A journey inside the brain â€“ from neuroanatomy to behavior* and *Physiological mechanisms of mental functions*), so attending lectures and reading lecture materials is assumend.

### **STUDENT PROJECT**
Projects will be completed in groups of 2-4 students and presented in a written form. The main idea of the project is to practice: 
* searching for neuroscientific information in available literature
* selecting relevant materials 
* reading less technical neuroscientific papers
* summarizing content of these materials

The projects will be completed in 5 steps. Students will:
* choose a topic for their project from a list of topics given by the teacher. Students can propose and consult topics for the project if they prefer so. The topics can range from function(s) of a given brain region (or a network o regions); mechanisms of given psychological funcion; how brain connectivity influences psychological phenomena; what are the neural mechanisms of a specific disorder etc.
* look for materials about this topic (google scholar, pubmed, science blogs, scholarpedia, book chapters).
* read through these sources, especially abstracts of scientific publications, sum up initial findings
* choose a few papers, look through figures, conclusions (maybe introduction too). describe what you understood, consult what you do not with the teacher
* write a summary on the basis of final selection of materials (this should consist of at least one experimental paper). Critical discussion of the materials will be encouraged.
Consultation and help from the teacher will be available at each of theses steps.

### IN-CLASS MEETINGS:
#### INTRODUCTION TO NEUROSCIENCE and its METHODS
* very basic introduction to neuroscience and overview of its branches and topics
* short overview of brain anatomy and function
* how do scientists get to know this? overview of neuroscientific methods
  structural and functional methods
  lesion studies, MRI, DTI, marking and tracing methods, (short mention of brainbow - nice pictures)
  fMRI, electode recordings, EEG, TMS, TDCS/TACS
* overview of resources helpful in learning about the brain (brain form top to bottom, scholarpedia ...)
* using Google Scholar and pubmed to find relevant information
* navigating structure of a neuroscientific paper
* understanding (neuro)scientific figures and results

#### NEURONS and NEUROANATOMY
* how do neurons communicate
* mechanisms of action potential generation and synaptic transmission
* neurons are social creatures: from neurons to networks - short discussion / group exercise
* understanding brain anatomy - overview of brain structures 
* presentation of a chosen interactive brain atlas

#### FROM STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION part I -  *motor and sensory systems*
* relationship between brain structure and function
* architecture of the visual system - how the visual information is processed
* how attention influences information processing (in neural terms)
* motor system - how movements are planned and executed

#### FROM STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION part II - *architecture of emotion and cognition*
* brain mechanisms responsible for: 
- control of attention
- memory (short and long term)
- emotions
- decision making

#### NEURAL OSCILLATIONS and BRAIN NETWORKS
* networks of communicating brain cells/regions - the real building block of cognition
* structural and functional networks
* how networks are studied
* the role of brain oscillations in network formation and information flow

#### NEUROSCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY - *brain mechanisms of consciousness and free will (volition)*
* contemporary neurocognitive theories of consciousness - global neuronal workspace, integrated information, higher order theories of consciousnes, radical plasticity thesis
* neural mechanisms of volition - Liebet and Soon experiments (unconscious precursors of conscious choices), mechanisms of agency and ownership (the feeling that we are in control of the actions)
